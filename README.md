# StrawberrySSD Project

This project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and focuses on using Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) for detecting strawberries and localizing weeds in a strawberry field. 
The notebook is designed to run in Google Colab and leverages various machine learning libraries such as PyTorch, torchvision, and others for image processing and object detection.

This notebook uses a custom made dataset, created by my team, downloaded from RoboFlow
